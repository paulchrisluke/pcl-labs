This is a placeholder for an image file.

In a real implementation, you would need to:
1. Create an actual JPG image file named "example-proposal.jpg"
2. Place it in the public/img/proposals/ directory (which may need to be created)
3. The image should ideally be a professional-looking business/marketing-related image that represents a digital transformation proposal

For now, this proposal will display without an image, and you can add a real image later.
