This is a placeholder for an image file.

In a real implementation, you would need to:
1. Create an actual JPG image file named "website-redesign.jpg"
2. Place it in the public/img/proposals/ directory
3. The image should ideally be a professional-looking website design mockup or wireframe that represents a website redesign project

For now, this proposal will display without an image, and you can add a real image later.
