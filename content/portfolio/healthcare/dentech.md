## Challenge 

Initially, Dentech faced significant challenges in engaging their audience effectively through email marketing. Their campaigns consistently struggled with low open rates of only 20-25%, reflecting a broader issue in capturing and maintaining customer interest. This underperformance highlighted a crucial need for a strategic overhaul to enhance their marketing communications and ultimately boost engagement and conversions. This initial difficulty set the stage for our agency to step in and transform Dentech’s digital marketing approach, starting with a revitalization of their email marketing strategies.

### From Email Marketing Success to Full-Stack Partnership

We initially joined forces with Dentech as email marketing consultants. Through strategic optimizations and compelling content creation, we achieved an impressive average open rate of 60% for their email campaigns. This significant improvement, exceeding their typical range of 20-25%, translated into higher click-through rates and conversions.

Given the remarkable success of our email marketing efforts, Dentech entrusted us with a broader scope of work. We leveraged our full-stack marketing expertise to develop a brand-new website that accurately reflected Dentech's values and capabilities. This website redesign was complemented by the implementation of email automation workflows to streamline communication and nurture leads. 

We expanded into multi-channel distribution—auditing existing social profiles, establishing a posting cadence, and producing thought-leadership clips tailored for LinkedIn and Facebook—to grow reach and brand awareness.

> "Paul is a force to be reckoned with. He is undeniably talented and is able to focus in on what the message is that needs to come across in the marketing piece. Our company is drowning in multiple marketing needs and Paul is able to allocate the resources needed for each piece and execute a plan of action. He has an uncanny ability to draw the vision out of the client and put it into marketing action. Our first email campaign brought in a 60% open rate through Paul's writing. This is up from our typical 20-25% open rate. The feedback, interaction and response rate from our clients from this campaign is priceless. The best move we ever made as a company with Paul's guidance. You would be a fool to not hire him." - Jane, CEO at Dentech

## Results

Through our collaborative efforts, Dentech experienced significant growth in brand awareness, customer engagement, and lead generation. The revamped website served as a robust platform to showcase Dentech's offerings, while our targeted marketing initiatives successfully reached and resonated with their target audience.
