**Unveiling the AMP Advantage:**

Our research revealed Google's AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) as the fastest loading platform available, but it was primarily used in the e-publishing sector. We collaborated with Google Developer Support to pioneer the adaptation of AMP for advertising pages, achieving record-breaking loading speeds.

**Why Speed Matters:**

A staggering 53% of mobile website visits are abandoned if pages take longer than 3 seconds to load. (Source: Google DoubleClick Blog) By leveraging AMP, we could ensure instant loading times for our clients' mobile pages.

**Strategic Innovation:**

As a Google Partner, we teamed up with Google Developer Support to adapt AMP technology for marketing and advertising sites. AMP pages preload with search results, ensuring instant availability for users upon clicking.

**Results:**

The implementation of AMP resulted in:

* **Instant-loading mobile pages:** Clients experienced a dramatic improvement in mobile page load speeds.
* **5x higher conversions:** Faster loading times translated into a significant 5x boost in conversions for our clients.
* **$1M projected yearly savings:** Increased conversions equated to a projected annual savings of $1 million for our clients.

**Global Recognition:**

The success of this innovative AMP solution garnered worldwide attention. PCL-Labs was invited to speak at Google's prestigious World AMP Conference 2018 in Amsterdam. This conference brought together thought leaders from Google, BuzzFeed, Doodle, Reddit, Vox Media, Airbnb, Booking.com, and PCL-Labs itself.

**By harnessing the power of Google AMP and fostering a collaborative partnership with Google Developer Support, PCL-Labs revolutionized the mobile advertising landscape.  This case study highlights the potential of innovative solutions to significantly increase mobile conversions and drive substantial cost savings.**
