## Optimizing the Customer Journey

We embarked on a comprehensive Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) audit of Yearly Co.'s Shopify Plus store. Utilizing heatmaps, user session recordings, and in-depth Shopify analytics, we gained valuable insights into customer behavior and identified areas for improvement. Our audit revealed opportunities to enhance the user journey from product discovery to checkout, making it easier for customers to find their perfect bangle and complete their purchase with confidence.

**Key Recommendations:**

* **Homepage Optimization:** We recommended refining the homepage to showcase the unique craftsmanship and stories behind Yearly Co.'s bangles. Highlighting the Nashville connection and the handmade aspect could resonate with customers seeking locally-made, high-quality jewelry.
* **Enhanced Product Discovery:** To improve product browsing, we suggested implementing user-friendly filters and categorization based on style, material, and color. Additionally, high-quality product photography and engaging product descriptions could further entice customers.
* **Personalized Shopping Experience:** We explored the potential of integrating personalized product recommendations, allowing customers to discover bangles that complement their individual style preferences.
