description: "Volkswagen sends many emailed internal communications to its various employees. However, due to the complexities of enterprise software integrations, they had limited tracking for their open, clicks, and engagement rates by user. Our CMS allowed marketing members to email the same newsletters and communications with 1:1 user level tracking, giving the marketing team the insight they needed to ensure their success."

## Challenge:

Volkswagen, a global automotive giant, thrives on effective internal communication. Daily email updates keep employees informed and engaged. However, their existing email system, while functional, presented a significant challenge: a lack of user-level tracking capabilities.

The Problem: Complexity Creates Blind Spots

Complex enterprise software integrations hampered Volkswagen's ability to track crucial email metrics. Marketing managers were left in the dark, unable to answer critical questions:

-   **Are Employees Reading Emails?** Open rates were a mystery, making it difficult to gauge employee engagement with critical information.
-   **Content Effectiveness:** Click-through rates and user interactions with specific content remained unknown, hindering content strategy.
-   **Was the Message Received?** Without insights into individual user behavior, marketing teams couldn't determine if vital messages were reaching their intended audience.

These knowledge gaps resulted in:

-   **Ineffective Communication:** Marketing efforts lacked the data-driven foundation needed to resonate with employees.
-   **Wasted Resources:** Time and resources were potentially poured into content that wasn't effectively reaching or engaging the target audience.
-   **Frustration and Missed Opportunities:** The inability to measure success hampered efforts to improve internal communication and employee engagement.

## Technologies Used

- Vue.js & .net
- Sendgrid
- Figma
