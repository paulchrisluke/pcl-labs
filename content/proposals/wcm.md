---

## Compliance & Risk Considerations

- **Meme and educational content will be reviewed to align with responsible DeFi communication practices.**
- **All messaging will avoid regulatory gray zones and prioritize institutional integrity.**

---

## Payment Options
**Flexible Billing Aligned to Operations:**

- **Hybrid Model:** 50/50 split between fiat (Stripe or Upwork) and crypto (subject to contributor preferences — some freelancers accept crypto, others do not)

---

## Additional Considerations for Institutional Review
- **Audit transparency & messaging strategy**: Clear articulation of security posture and trust-building via third-party verification.
- **Benchmarking**: Side-by-side content comparing WCM to other DeFi or CeFi venues.
- **Operational maturity**: Communication calendar, CRM integration, analytics setup (HubSpot included).
- **Scalable media approach**: Modular contributors (video, memes, design) coordinated under one strategy.
- **CMS Migration Efficiency**: Website migration to HubSpot ensures seamless integration of CRM, content strategy, and analytics.
