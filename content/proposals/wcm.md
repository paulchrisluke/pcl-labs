# WCM Marketing & Social Media Proposal

## Executive Summary
WCM is positioned to become the leading platform for on-chain leveraged trading, but currently lacks the consistent public content, strategic messaging, and community engagement required to build institutional trust and market visibility.

## Goals

- Educate users on WCM's unique offerings (basis trade, cross-margining, CLOBs, MegaETH).

---

## Additional Considerations for Institutional Review
- **Audit transparency & messaging strategy**: Clear articulation of security posture and trust-building via third-party verification.
- **Benchmarking**: Side-by-side content comparing WCM to other DeFi or CeFi venues.
- **Operational maturity**: Communication calendar, CRM integration, analytics setup (HubSpot included).
- **Scalable media approach**: Modular contributors (video, memes, design) coordinated under one strategy.
- **CMS Migration Efficiency**: Website migration to HubSpot ensures seamless integration of CRM, content strategy, and analytics.
