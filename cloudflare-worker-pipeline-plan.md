# Cloudflare Worker Pipeline Plan

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Working Components
1. **Transcription Pipeline**: Working with 9/10 clips transcribed successfully
2. **R2 Assets Worker**: Fixed - asset serving now working via main worker
3. **Python Audio API**: ✅ **FIXED** - Now working with Redis integration
   - Health endpoint: `/api/health` ✅
   - Clip status endpoint: `/api/clip-status/{clip_id}` ✅
   - Redis cache: ✅ Healthy
   - R2 storage: ✅ Configured
   - FFmpeg: ❌ Not available (expected on Vercel serverless)

### Current Pipeline Status
- **Total clips processed**: 10
- **Successfully transcribed**: 9/10 (90% success rate)
- **Asset serving**: ✅ Working via main worker
- **Python API**: ✅ Working with Redis
- **R2 storage**: ✅ All components functional
- **All tests passing**: ✅ Health, Twitch, GitHub, Pipeline, Deduplication, Audio, Transcription

## Current Issues to Fix (IMMEDIATE)
- ✅ ~~R2 asset serving URLs returning 404s~~ - **FIXED**
- ✅ ~~Python API deployment failing~~ - **FIXED**
- ✅ ~~Redis integration missing~~ - **FIXED**
- ✅ ~~Server configuration error (missing admin tokens)~~ - **FIXED** - Now using HMAC_SHARED_SECRET

## Next Milestone: M8 - GitHub Integration (NEXT PRIORITY)

### Implementation Plan
1. **GitHub Webhook Setup**
   - Create GitHub webhook for repository events
   - Configure webhook to trigger on PR merges, commits, releases
   - Set up webhook endpoint in Cloudflare Worker

2. **GitHub API Integration**
   - Implement GitHub API client in Cloudflare Worker
   - Fetch PR details, commit messages, release notes
   - Store GitHub event data in R2

3. **Clip-GitHub Linking**
   - Create linking mechanism between clips and GitHub events
   - Store metadata linking clips to specific PRs/commits
   - Implement search/filter by GitHub context

4. **Enhanced Blog Content**
   - Modify blog post generation to include GitHub context
   - Add GitHub event summaries to clip descriptions
   - Include links to relevant PRs/commits

### Technical Requirements
- GitHub Personal Access Token or OAuth App
- Webhook secret for security
- GitHub API rate limiting handling
- R2 storage for GitHub event data
- Database schema for clip-GitHub relationships

### Files to Create/Modify
- `src/services/github.ts` - GitHub API client
- `src/routes/github.ts` - GitHub webhook endpoints
- `src/types/github.ts` - GitHub event types
- Update existing clip processing to include GitHub context
